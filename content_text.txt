title: "Mercado de Colón!"
question: "Why did this old market hall end up featured in Accidentally Wes Anderson?"
body: "<b>What it is:</b> Mercado de Colón is a gorgeous Art Nouveau market hall from 1916 that has been transformed into a chic dining and shopping arcade. Flanking Calle Jorge Juan in Pla del Remei, its two grand entrances are like triumphal arches of brick and iron: one side a towering pointed arch flanked by slender domed towers, the other a more rectilinear modernista façade – both richly decorated with ceramic flowers, fruits, and Valencian symbols in the mosaics. Inside, an airy metal and glass structure (resembling a train station or cathedral nave) shelters trendy cafés, restaurants, and gourmet stalls. It’s an architectural feast that now hosts actual feasts, as locals come here to eat, drink, and socialize under the soaring roof.<br><br>

<b>Why it’s interesting</b> For visitors, Mercado de Colón offers a two-in-one experience: you get to admire one of Valencia’s most beautiful buildings and enjoy a meal or coffee at the same time. The architecture is stunning: elaborate ironwork, stained-glass windows, and colorful trencadís (mosaic tile) detailing in the banisters and walls will keep your eyes wandering even as you sip an horchata or craft beer.<br><br>

Each façade has unique details – for example, one side has a giant mosaic of Valencia’s coat of arms, the other has playful ornaments like bats and oranges hidden among the stonework. The market’s interior is equally photogenic, often bathed in natural light. Unlike a traditional crowded market, the space feels open and elegant, allowing you to fully appreciate the design. It’s no surprise the building was included in the “Accidentally Wes Anderson” collection of remarkable sites – there’s a symmetry and color here that’s very delightful. Live cultural events sometimes take place here too; don’t be surprised if you stumble upon a small jazz concert or artisan fair under its metal canopy. All this makes Mercado de Colón not just a food stop but a destination in its own right, exuding that coveted mix of history and hip atmosphere.<br><br>

<b>Backstory</b> Designed by architect Francisco Mora Berenguer and inaugurated in 1916, Mercado de Colón was originally a neighborhood fresh market for Valencia’s upscale Ensanche residents. Mora was influenced by Catalan Modernism (think Gaudí and Domènech i Montaner), which is evident in the floral ceramic inlays and parabolic arch shapes. The market thrived through the early-mid 20th century but fell into disrepair by the 1980s after it closed. Thankfully, it was declared a National Historic Monument, and an ambitious restoration in 2003 brought it back to life. The restoration preserved the beautiful facades and structural skeleton, while excavating the floor to add lower-level shops and a parking area out of sight. Today, instead of produce stalls and butchers, you’ll find patisseries, tapas bars, and design boutiques – a modern reuse that has been very successful. The market often hosts events (holiday markets, live music, cultural exhibitions) beneath its stunning metal structure, continuing its legacy as a community gathering place. Whether you’re there to dine or just to admire the surroundings, notice features like the wrought-iron columns and roof beams – they were cutting-edge engineering in 1916, akin to Paris’s Eiffel-era pavilions. Mercado de Colón beautifully illustrates how a city can preserve its architectural heritage by adapting it to contemporary uses, and for any traveler, it’s an absolute highlight of L’Eixample."
